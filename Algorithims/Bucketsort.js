// there are many different implementations of this algorithm, this is just one!
// Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
// For exmaple, sorting a large set of floating point numbers which are in range
// from 0.0 to 1.0  and are uniformly distributed across the range. see the link:
// http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bucket-sort-2/. Note that the solution provided
// here would fail with a set of whole numbers which are not evenly distrubed.
